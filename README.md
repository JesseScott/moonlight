**moonlight** is a mobile application that programatically enlightens the screen based on an algorithm fueled by realtime moon data - phase, angle, azimuth, etc.

It is developed by the artist [Jesse Scott](http://jesses.co.tt) and was originally inspired an idea by the artist [Kelly Andres](https://kellyandres.xyz).

It is heavily indebted to the [SunCalc](https://github.com/shred/commons-suncalc) library, as well as several other open source frameworks. We all stand upon the shoulders of giants.
