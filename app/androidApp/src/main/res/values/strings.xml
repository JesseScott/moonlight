        The above data is a realtime representation of the moon\'s current status. The data is used as an algorithm to render a custom gradient.
        \n\nThe gradient\'s hue is attained by mapping the current phase, which starts at -180.0 (new moon, waxing), passes 0.0 (full moon) and moves toward 180.0 (waning, new moon).
        \n\nSaturation is driven by the altitude - 0.0 means the moon\'s center is at the horizon, 90.0 at the zenith (straight over your head).
        \n\nLightness is derived from the angle of the moon illumination relative to earth. The moon is waxing if the angle is negative, and waning if positive.
        \n\nThe alpha of the gradient is extracted from the illuminated fraction of the moon - .0 indicates new moon, 1.0 indicates full moon.
